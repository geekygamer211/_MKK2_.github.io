    <p class=warning>This is a very political assignment. Prepare. </p>
    <p class=para1>
        I will write some great placeholder text – and nobody writes better placeholder text than me, believe me – and I’ll write it very inexpensively. I will write some great, great text on your website’s 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico–United_States_border">Southern border,</a> and I will make Google pay for that text. Mark my words.

        An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama">Barack Obama's</a> placeholder text is a fraud. The concept of Lorem Ipsum was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. design jobs non-competitive. An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. Lorem Ispum is a choke artist. It chokes!

        If <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump>Trump</a> Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text.
